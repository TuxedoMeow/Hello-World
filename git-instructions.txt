Did you make a new repository?
1. git clone https://gitlab.com/acdeleon/REPO_HERE.git
    (Github: https://github.com/acfromspace/REPO_HERE.git)
2. cd REPOSITORY_HERE
3. touch README.md
4. git add README.md
5. git commit -m "put your message here"
6. git push -u origin master (Replaces all the files in the master)

Did you just edit some code and want to push?
1. Change directory to respective folder. (For example CS514 would need to be in CS514 folder.)
2. git init (To let git know this is what's about to be transported.)
3. // git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/acdeleon/REPOSITORY_HERE.git (IF GIT HAS NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE)
4. git add . (adds all files)
5. git commit -m "put your message here"
6. git push -u origin master (Replaces all the files in the master)

Did you edit some code else where and want to pull?

Don't have any of the files and need to get them?
1. git clone https://gitlab.com/acdeleon/REPOSITORY_HERE.git

Make sure to have descriptions on ALL files.
