# MICROSOFT

## Round 1 (Phone)

- 30 minutes with Recruiter.
- Behavioral and technical.
- Apples and oranges riddle.
  - In front of you are 3 boxes.
  - One box contains only apples, another box contains only oranges, and the last contains both apples and oranges.
  - Currently the first box has the label “apples,” the second “oranges,” and the third “apples and oranges.”
  - Unfortunately all of the labels are wrong. Your job is to fix the labels.
  - You are not allowed to peek inside any of the boxes, but you can ask for a sample from any box only once.
  - How do you fix the labels according to the correct basket?
- "Explain recursion to a 5 year old."
- "Why do you want to work for Microsoft?"

## Round 2 (?)

- Did not make it.
