## Round 1 (Phone)

- 30 minutes.
- Technical questions from a Senior Software Engineer.
- "What is the differences between public, private, and protected scope?"
  - Public can be used to make the variable/function available anywhere.
  - Private can be used to make the variable/function available within it's own class.
  - Protected can be used to make the variable/function available in all classes that extend the current class including the parent class.
- "What is an XOR?"
  - If both values are equal, return 0, if not, return 1.
- "What is an abstract class?"
  - A type of interface but not really, not strict, but something for classes to base off of.
- "What is an interface?"
  - An interface is a programming structure/syntax that allows the computer to enforce certain properties on an object (class).
  - For example a vehicle interface has a `start_engine()` method in which classes car, truck, and motorcycle share.
- "Overriding vs Overloading?"
  - Overriding is when two methods are the same name and parameters, but one is the parent class and the other is the child class.
  - Overloading is when two methods are the same name and same class, but different parameters.
- "What does "static" mean in Java?"
  - Static allows the access of a method publicly.
- "Difference between a method and function?"
  - A method is used exclusively in object-oriented programming.
  - A function is used to take input to give output.
- "What's a recursive function?"
  - A function that calls itself.
- "How would you code a program that returns the last integer of an integer?"
  - `(number % 10)` this will always give the remainder which is the last integer.
- "How would you code a program that prints an integer that is a multiple of 3 and 5?"

```py
function fizzbuzz(number):
    for index in len(number):
        if index % 15 == 0:
            print(index)
```

- "How would you code the previous program appending the elements to a list instead?"

```py
function fizzbuzz(number):
    output_list = []
    for index in len(number):
        if index % 15 == 0:
            output_list.append(index)
    return output_list
```

- "Why do you like Software Engineering?"
  - I love finding solutions upon existing solutions. I love contributing to a technological world where it's constantly evolving. At the very essence, being on the frontier of discovery is what makes me love Software Engineering.

## Round 2 (On-Site)

- Did not make it.
