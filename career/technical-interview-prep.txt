1a. DATA STRUCTURES
###################################################################

Write the code and play around with it, especially on paper.

    Array
        A sequence of elements.
        Searching is instant if you're looking for a[3], boom, O(1)!
    Linked List
        A sequence of elements which links an element to the next
        element.
        Takes a bit time to search for a certain element as it's
        a congo line, O(n).
        Insert and deleting takes O(1) time if it's in the beginning
        of the linked list.
        Insert and deleting takes O(n), especially if it's at the end
        of the linked list.
    Doubly Linked List
        A sequence of elements which links an element to the next
        element and the previous element.
    Stack/Queue
        Flexible with sizes and linear data structures.
        Stack is LIFO, last in first out.
        Queue is FIFO, first in first out.
    Trees (Tree, Binary, Binary Search Tree, Red Black, etc.)
        Trees have 1 root and multiple children, sometimes leaves
            (leaves mean children w/o children)
        Binary Trees only have 0 to 2 child nodes when navigating.
        Binary Search Trees are Binary Trees w/ a specific order to
            them.
        Mind the different traversal methods.
    Heap
        There are min heaps and max heaps.
        Min heaps, children are always bigger than the parent, inserting
            from left to right depending on the level.
        You can use an algorithm to balance the heap to move insertions.
        When removing the root, we take the last element and insert to
            the root element.
    Hash Table (Very important)
        Key => Value (Think dictionaries in Python)
        Key => Hash Code => Index
        Be weary of collisions if 2 keys === the same hash code, or if 2
            hash codes === the same index.
        Collisions can be fixed through chaining (linked lists to array
            indices)
        Getting and setting? O(1) (if it's a good hashtable)
            O(n) (if it's a terrible hashtable)
    Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs
    Trie (pronounced "tree")
    Linked Hash Map

You should know the Big-O for insert, delete, lookup, etc. for each
    of these.
How do each of these contain data?

###################################################################
2a. ALGORITHMS
###################################################################

Write the code and play around with it, especially on paper.

    Sorting Algorithms
    Tree Traversals
    Traversals (Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS)
    All the prefix-tree searches

Before writing a single line of code, validate with the interviewer
    that your approach is a good one.

Things people say isn't important, but actually are.

    Writing Code
    Bits and Bytes
    How the Internet works
    Databases
    Testing
    Linux
    Random

Writing Code

    Some people can't program and it happens, especially with senior
        software engineers. You don't have to write production code, 
        but be expected to at least know some code.

Bits and Bytes

    Understand how bitshifting works in whatever language you're
        going to interview with. The difference between big and 
        little endian. "Write a function to determine if the bit 
        wise representation of an integer is a palindrome."

How the Internet works

    How do sockets work? What's TCP/IP? What's HTTP? Learn about 
        networking layers and what's responsible for what.

Databases

    Learn some basic SQL and data modeling

Testing

    Write some code, test it, what's a TDD? (Technical Design Doc)

Random

    Difference between recursion and iteration?
        Recursion calls itself while iteration keeps the motion.
        Recursion is like doing 5x5 weight sets as iteration is
            doing as much pull ups as you can.
    Difference between override and overload?
        Override is having two methods with the same name and
            parameters.
        Overload is having two methods with the same name but
            different parameters.

4a. BEHAVIORAL
###################################################################

Come across as someone people want to work with.

Best to come with 3 situations with a tech project went well and
    3 situations with a tech project that didn't go so well.

"Tell me about a project you worked on?"

STAR Format (or CAR, C meaning "Context")

S - Situation
T - Task
A - Action
R - Result

(Considered what you learned and the hardships encountered as well)

S:
    Aztec Game Lab, a game development organization at SDSU, was in need
    of an online space where users could interact with their teams as well
    as share game assets, share content, in a secluded ad-free area.
T:
    Our task was to create this said website with 6 developers, using an
    Agile/Scrum 1 week sprint method in order to be used by 2019.
A:
    We took the foundations of React/Redux/Firebase to work with and created
    designs and templates from user accounts, chat room connections, and
    post sharing.
R:
    Result is that we are still working on it at the moment, we have finished
    the bare bones of the code where we know the website works, it's just now
    the styling, documenting, and distributing to the users is what is left.

5a. PARTING WORDS
###################################################################

Expect to fail and to succeed in interviews.
Understand that interviews are interviews, not family gatherings.
