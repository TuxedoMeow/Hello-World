# BASH SCRIPTS

## Computer Freeze

- `:(){ :|:& };:`
  - Essentially a recursion call that calls it's parent twice, so an infinite tree which causes the PC to freeze.

## Infinite Output

- `yes`
  - Prints out `y` consecutively in a column.
- `yes '<something>`
  - Prints out `<something>` consecutively in a column.
- `yes 69|tr '\n' ' '`
  - Prints out `420` every space, and starts a new line when the amount in the line is filled.
