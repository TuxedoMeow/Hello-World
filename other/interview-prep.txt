S:
    Aztec Game Lab, a game development organization at SDSU, was in need
    of an online space where users could interact with their teams as well
    as share game assets, share content, in a secluded ad-free area.
T:
    Our task was to create this said website with 6 developers, using an
    Agile/Scrum 1 week sprint method in order to be used by 2019.
A:
    We took the foundations of React/Redux/Firebase to work with and created
    designs and templates from user accounts, chat room connections, and
    post sharing.
R:
    Result is that we are still working on it at the moment, we have finished
    the bare bones of the code where we know the website works, it's just now
    the styling, documenting, and distributing to the users is what is left.
