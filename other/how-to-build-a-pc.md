## 1: Introduction

- This is a simple guide of how to build a PC via purchasing the parts.
- I highly recommend using `pcpartpicker.com` for reference.
  - Make sure the parts your pick are compatible with each other!
- Always consider your budget.

## 2: What parts to choose first?

- Do you care about aesthetics?
  - Case.
- Do you want to do video editing?
  - CPU.
- Do you want to game?
  - GPU.
- Why not choose other parts first?
  - The three above are the most important as opposed to the other parts.
  - Everything else is "filler".

## 2.1: Case

- There are 4 different types of cases:
  - Small form factor. (Mini-ITX)
  - Mini tower. (Micro-ATX)
  - Mid tower. (ATX)
  - Full tower. (EATX)
- What to consider?
  - Aesthetics.
    - What's your favorite color?
  - Ports.
    - Do you want to use multiple USB ports?
  - Size.
    - How much desk space do you have?

## 2.2: Central Process Unit (CPU)

- What to consider?
  - Brand.
    - AMD VS Intel?
  - Generation, cores, threads, clock speed. (In that respective order.)
    - How much work will you be doing?

## 2.2.1: CPU Cooler

- There are a few different types of cooling methods.
  - Air.
  - Liquid.
- What to consider?
  - Amount of work done.
    - Is what your doing demanding from the CPU? (Video editing.)
  - Clearance.
    - Is this going to fit in the case?

## 2.3: Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

- What to consider?
  - Brand.
    - AMD VS Intel VS Nvidia?
  - Clearance.
    - Is this going to fit in the case?
    - Are you okay with GPU sag depending on the case you get?
  - Cooling solution.
    - Do you want 1 fan, 2 fans, 3 fans, etc.?
    - Do you want the GPU enclosed for visuals or open for performance?
  - Core clock.
    - Do you want to overclock?
  - Memory/VRAM.
    - How much work needs to be done with large datasets?
  - Monitor.
    - Will the GPU provide the necessary power and specs to make your monitor used at the full potential? (Think about this vice versa too.)

## 2.4: Memory (RAM)

- What to consider?
  - Frequency.
    - How much work will you be doing at once?
  - CAS latency.
    - Do you want performance?
      - Lower the CAS latency, the better.
  - Memory channels.
    - What communication do you want with the RAM to the CPU?
      - Generally should be at least 2 RAM in each motherboard.
      - Anything lower than that will not be able to utilize dual channels systems which is needed.

## 2.5: Motherboard

Hello.

## 2.6: Operating System

Hello.

## 2.7: Peripherals

Hello.

## 2.7.1: Keyboard

Hello.

## 2.7.2: Monitor

- Different panel types for monitors:
  - Do you want your games to have the most accurate perceived color? Get IPS, settle for VA, avoid TN, due to the viewing angles.
  - Do you want your games to offer the most immersive picture quality? Get VA (the contrast adds more perceived depth), settle for IPS, avoid TN (similar contrast, worse color accuracy due to viewing angles).
  - Do you want the highest refresh rates possible? Get TN, settle for IPS, avoid VA, due to response times.
- Use this to detect dead pixels.

## 2.8: Mouse

What to consider?

## 2.9: Storage

Hello.

## 3: Conclusion

- Thank you.
