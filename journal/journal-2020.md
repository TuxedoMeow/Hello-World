- What is the relationship of `Spectron` to `WebdriverIO` and `Selenium WebDriver`?
  - `Selenium WebDriver` allows developers to write tests that control a web browser so they can test apps from a user's perspective.
  - `WebdriverIO` wraps the `Selenium WebDriver` with a pleasant `JavaScript` API and makes it easy to use from within `Node.js` or an `Electron` application in our case.
  - `Spectron` allows access to `WebdriverIO` with a environment custom-tailored functionality for `Electron` applications.
- What is the primary way to use `Spectron`?
  - Create an `Application` instance.
  - This object includes a number of child objects that allow us to access different parts of the application.
- What are the different parts of `Spectron`?
  - `client`
    - The underlying `WebdriverIO` instance.
  - `electron`
    - `Electron`'s renderer process API.
  - `browserWindow`
    - The currently focused browser window.
  - `webContents`
    - `Electron`'s WebContents API.
  - `mainProcess`
    - Node's process object in the main process.
  - `rendererProcess`
    - Node's process object in the renderer process.
- Is it better to have the front-end and back-end in the same repo or separate repos.
  - Depends.
  - Usually separate repos is desirable due to modularization and scalability.
  - Reasons for same repos is for the engineers to understand the product as a whole.
- How does a standard `Electron` test file look like?

```js
const Application = require("spectron").Application; // `Spectron`'s application driver.
const assert = require("assert"); // `Node.js`'s built in assertion library.
const electronPath = require("electron"); // Locally installed development version of `Electron`.
const path = require("path"); // `Node.js`'s helper utility for working with file paths.

const app = new Application({
  path: electronPath,
  args: [path.join(__dirname, "..")], // Points to root directory of application as a starting point.
});

describe("Application launch", function() {
  this.timeout(10000); // `Mocha`'s default timeout because launching can take a while.

  beforeEach(() => {
    return app.start(); // Starts application before each test.
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    if (app && app.isRunning()) {
      return app.stop(); // Stops the application after each test.
    }
  });

  it("should have 1 window", function() {
    const count = await app.client.getWindowCount();
    return assert.equal(count, 1);
  })
});
```

- What is `Mocha`?
  - JavaScript test framework running on `Node.js` and in the browser.
- What is `Chai`?

- How to run scripts after one each other in `Linux`?
  - Use `&` between scripts.
- How to run scripts simultaneously in `Linux`?
  - Use `|` between scripts.

- What is a traditional virtualization?
  - Hardware (Server).
  - Operating System.
  - Hypervisor (Translating system for app to OS).
  - Multiple VMS.
- What is a traditional containerization?
  - Hardware (Server).
  - Operating System.
  - Containers.
- What are the differences between VMs VS. containers?
  - VMs are not as flexible when utilizing resources on the hardware where containers are flexible and use what it needs, not fixed.
- Why use `Docker`?
  - Makes it easy to develop and deploy apps inside neat containers.
- Instead of controlling 1 container at a time, `Docker Compose` is a tool to use to affect multiple containers at once.
