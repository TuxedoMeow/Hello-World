- Updated creddle.io resume.
  - Updated skills to go from "advanced, proficient, exploring" rather than placed by "programming languages, web technologies, creative software engines, databases".
    - I thought this was necessary to avoid questions on topics I wasn't too familiar about because there were no skill levels to differentiate.
  - Removed the `knucklesbattle` repo with the `acfromspacex` repo to harbor current technologies I'm working with which is mainly `ReactJS` as well as touching other technologies such as `GraphQL` and `Apollo'.
- Cleaned out the Thunderbird email!
- Applied to CyberCoders.
- Messaged Anthony, host of San Diego JavaScript Community Talks, about performing a talk.
- Messaged the General Assembly group of LA about future hackathons.
  - Feels nice to have a community dev spot for me in LA!

- Created a Gitbook for the repository of `infinitygauntlet`.
  - Gitbook is a hosting platform to showcase markdown files in a repository. Great for making books.
