- I remember your smile with the sun in your eyes,
And the smell of the summer, the sound of the breeze -
I remember your shape under powder-blue skies;
Under wandering clouds; under whispering trees.

I remember the feel of the grass at our back,
And the touch of its warmth, and the cool of the shade,
And the calls of our friends from the river-way track,
And the season that last for an age when it stayed.

I remember the fire we built of a night,
And the sight of the stars as they slipped in a stream,
And the furtive first-kiss that we shared by its light,
And the simple, impossible, innocent dream.

I remember you most in the starlight above,
But for you it was fun - and for me it was love.

So please don't break my heart like those before
Because you are the one I truly adore
- The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock index made up of 30 of the largest companies in the country- companies like Disney, Boeing, Visa, and Microsoft. Each stock has a certain weight based on what it needed to be to keep the index the same when they swapped the stock onto the index- (they keep changing up the stocks that make it up, and General Electric is the only one of the original stocks that's still on the index).

The Nasdaq composite is an index made up of all the stocks on the Nasdaq stock exchange (but not the ones on the New York Stock Exchange or any other exchange). Technology stocks make up a bigger portion of the Nasdaq than the NYSE, so technology is over-represented in the Nasdaq composite number.

The S&P 500 is made up of about 500 large companies, which together count for the vast majority of all stock trading. This index is probably more representative of the economy as a whole than the Nasdaq (which is too heavy on technology) or the Dow (which only covers 30 companies).

IRDM ($6B) and TRMB ($17B) top the list and KTOS ($3.5B) is number 5, and there is no reason to believe ARKX will look any different. There will be tons of money flowing into these stocks when the ETF is released. Everyone seems to have figured out SPCE, but it feels like TRMB and KTOS are super under the radar here.
