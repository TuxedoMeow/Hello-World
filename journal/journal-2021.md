- In `JavaScript`, how does one insert characters in a string at specific locations, I.E. a phone number?

```js
// Link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6981793/12458952

var n = "1234567899";
console.log(n.replace(/(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})/, "$1-$2-$3")); // Returns "123-456-7899".
```

- In `JavaScript`, what are some key things to note about the `JavaScript Date` object?

new Date("2011-09-24"); // "Year-Month-Day".
// => Fri Sep 23 2011 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - ONE DAY OFF.

new Date("09-24-2011");
// => Sat Sep 24 2011 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - CORRECT DATE.

new Date("2011/09/24"); // Change from "-" to "/".
// => Sat Sep 24 2011 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - CORRECT DATE.
```

}
```
