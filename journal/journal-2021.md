Former optician here!

I highly recommend polycarbonate lenses (as opposed to a basic plastic lens- also known as CR) they are more durable and naturally scratch-resistant and have UV protection. When I worked as an optician, we could only add UV and scratch resistant coatings to a basic plastic lens.

High Index Lenses are typically better suited for prescriptions under - 2 but of course that is up to your personal preference. Some frames are not well-suited to high index lenses.

Anti-Reflective Coating helps reduce glare from nighttime driving, computer screens and helps reduce eye fatigue. If your eyes are sensitive to changes in light it is worth the cost.

Transitions/tinting is completely personal preference. Just be aware most transitions are NOT polarized the way normal sunglasses are.

If you have any other questions Iâ€™d be happy to help :)

- Finally finished my long task.

- In `React`, how should autosave be handled in terms of string inputs?
  
```js
// With autosave.
const [autoSave, setAutoSave] = useState("");
const [state, setState] = useStateWithCallback("");

const handleState = (event) => {
    setState(event, (update) => console.log("Do something with update", update));
}

const stateAutoSave = (event) => {
    setAutoSave(event);
    if (autoSave.length % 10 === 0 && autoSave.length !== 0) {
        handleState(event);
    }
}

onBlur={(event) => handleState(event.target.value)};
onChange={(event) => stateAutoSave(event.target.value)};

// Without autosave.
const [state, setState] = useStateWithCallback("");

const handleState = (event) => {
    console.log("Do something with state", state);
}

onBlur={handleState};
onChange={(event) => setState(event.target.value)};
```

- Time to teach `MongoDB`!
  - Went really well! Besides the `.git` mess we ended up in, mostly due to `NetBeans` IDE going into `IntelliJ` IDE.
- In `IntelliJ`, how does one organize the imports in alphabetical order?
  - `Ctrl + Alt + O`
  - This also adds required imports and removes unneeded imports.

- Finally back to work with the whole team.
- In `JavaScript`, how does one insert characters in a string at specific locations, I.E. a phone number?

```js
// Link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6981793/12458952

var n = "1234567899";
console.log(n.replace(/(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})/, "$1-$2-$3")); // Returns "123-456-7899".
```

- In `JavaScript`, what are some key things to note about the `JavaScript Date` object?

```js
// Link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/31732581/12458952

new Date("2011-09-24"); // "Year-Month-Day".
// => Fri Sep 23 2011 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - ONE DAY OFF.

new Date("09-24-2011");
// => Sat Sep 24 2011 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - CORRECT DATE.

new Date("2011/09/24"); // Change from "-" to "/".
// => Sat Sep 24 2011 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - CORRECT DATE.
```

- How does one `return` with a ternary?

```java
// Link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23089965/12458952

public static String createCharacterElement(Character character) {
    return character.getElement() != null ? "Element: " + character.getElement() : "Element: N/A";
}
```
