# -v = be verbose and show remote url after name

git remote add -f OTHER_REPO https://github.com/USER/OTHER_REPO.git
# add = add the branch
# -f = download objects and refs from another repo

git merge -s ours --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories OTHER_REPO/master
# merge = combine branches into one branch
# -s = short output
# --no-commit = doesn't perform the commit as actions aren't finished yet
# --allow-unrelated-histories = provides ease of merge

git read-tree --prefix=OTHER_REPO/ -u OTHER_REPO/master
# read-tree = reads tree info into the new repo index
# --prefix = what to name the new folder of other branch being transferred
# -u = update the files in the work tree with the result of the merge

git commit -m "Merge OTHER_REPO into NEW_REPO"
# commit = you are satisfied with the merge
# -m = message to be attached to commit
