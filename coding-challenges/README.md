# CODING CHALLENGES

Contains all coding challenges and the variance.

## Note!

- In my personal opinion, best to view the source files and the specific file you're looking for.

- Exercises done from:
  - **Firecode.** Gives you problems that machine learn your completion. Also reviews previous questions to condition your habits.
  - **Hackerrank.** Gives tons of problems, albeit sometimes the website isn't complete in certain areas! Great discussion boards.
  - **Leetcode.** Gives problems that strictly relate to data structures and algorithms. Curates company questions!
