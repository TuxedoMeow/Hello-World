Notes:

- Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines on how to tackle certain problems.
- What types of design patterns are there?

  - Creational.
    - Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.
    - Simple Factory.
    - Factory Method.
    - Abstract Factory.
    - Builder.
    - Prototype.
    - Singleton.
  - Structural.
    - Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other.
    - "How to build a software component?"
  - Behavioral.
    - It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them.
    - "How to run a behavior in software component?"

- Creational!

  - Singleton.
    - Restricts a class to the instantiation to one object.
    - A president usually deals with all the actions a country makes.

- Structural!

  - Adapter.
    - Able to wrap an object in an adapter to make it compatible for another class.
    - Eases working with source code when dealing with big source code.
  - Bridge.
    - Preferring composition over inheritance. Goes from one hierarchy to several.
    - Instead of having a theme to each page, put a theme to the website.

- Behavioral!

  - Observer.
    - Defines a dependency between objects so that whenever an object changes its state, all its dependents are notified.
    - Job postings alert a user if there are new postings.
  - State.
    - Able to change behavior of a class when state changes.
    - If a user is logged in, their details are shown.
