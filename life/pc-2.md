## CPU

- Went with the Ryzen 7 3700X.
  - Main reason was budget and getting something enough to do everything.
    - Game.
    - Edit.
    - Stream.

## GPU

- Went with the RTX 2070 Super over the RX 5700 XT.
  - Main reason is sound and specs, but the drawback is paying more.

## RAM

- Consider using 2 sticks instead of 1 due to dual channel memory.
  - Impacts speed.

## PSU

- Went with "gold" efficiency over anything else.
  - Best bang for buck, literally goldilocks zone.

## Peripherals

- Monitor
- REcommended 16:9
- Use this to detect dead pixels.

## Notes

- Windows 10 Home VS Windows 10 Pro

  - Windows 10 Home is more than enough for the individual.

- Different panel types for monitors:
  - Do you want your games to have the most accurate perceived color? Get IPS, settle for VA, avoid TN, due to the viewing angles.
  - Do you want your games to offer the most immersive picture quality? Get VA (the contrast adds more perceived depth), settle for IPS, avoid TN (similar contrast, worse color accuracy due to viewing angles).
  - Do you want the highest refresh rates possible? Get TN, settle for IPS, avoid VA, due to response times.
