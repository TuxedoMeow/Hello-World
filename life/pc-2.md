## CPU

- Went with the Ryzen 7 3700X.
  - Main reason was budget and getting something enough to do everything.
    - Game.
    - Edit.
    - Stream.

## GPU

- Went with the RTX 2070 Super over the RX 5700 XT.
  - Main reason is sound and specs, but the drawback is paying more.

## RAM

- Consider using 2 sticks instead of 1 due to dual channel memory.
  - Impacts speed.

## PSU

- Went with "gold" efficiency over anything else.
  - Best bang for buck, literally goldilocks zone.
