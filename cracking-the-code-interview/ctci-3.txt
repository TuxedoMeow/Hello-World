3: SPECIAL SITUATIONS

Testers and SDETs (software design engineers in test):
    Prepare the Core Testing Problems:
        How would you test a light bulb?
        A pen?
        A cash register?
    Practice the Coding Questions:
        Number one reason why SDETS get rejected.
        Do the usual coding and algorithm questions.
    Practice Testing the Coding Questions:
        "Write code to do X"
        ... & then after doing so
        "Test the code if it functions properly"
    Note:
        SDET position is easier than most, but a job to be stuck in.
    
Product (and Program) Management:
    Handling Ambiguity:
        
    Note:
        Vary wildly across companies and even within a company.
